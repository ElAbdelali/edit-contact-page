Subject: URGENT Customer Service team is requesting changes!

Unfortunately, the Web Development team went to Lake Tahoe after they
released the latest code for our contact page.

It looks fantastic to me, but the Customer Service department is
requesting some changes after receiving a few phone calls.

I'm sending you the contact page (contact.html) along with the static
folder needed to go with it. You don't need to do anything special to open
and view it, just open the file in a browser.

The CS team has listed out the problems they're getting calls about
below:

* The subtitle is a little intimidating
* People are complaining the headers seem to be yelling
* The new logo image in the static directory needs to replace the old one

Thanks for your help!!!

# To Do
    1. Open contact.html in your browser. You can do this in most browsers by clicking File > Open File…

    2. Edit contact.html to resolve the problems. Here are some suggestions:

    3. The uppercased title makes it sound like it’s shouting. Edit the title so it looks more professional.

    4. Change the logo being from rsz_logo.jpg to new_logo.png

    5. Edit the other parts of the page that make Ubermelon seem unpleasant
